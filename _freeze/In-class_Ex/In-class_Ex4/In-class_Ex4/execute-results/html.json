This is particularly useful when the relationship between your dependent and independent variables might vary across space, such as in spatial regression analysis.\n\n# Data and Packages\n\nFor this exercise, we will be focusing on Hunan. The following data sets will be used:\n\n-   Hunan county boundary layer. This is a geospatial data set in ESRI shapefile format.\n\n-   Hunan_2012.csv: This csv file contains selected Hunanâ€™s local development indicators in 2012.\n\nThe following packages are used:\n\n-   **`sf`**: Provides simple features support for handling and analyzing spatial vector data in R.\n-   **`spdep`**: A package for spatial dependence and spatial regression analysis, particularly for handling spatial weights.\n-   **`tmap`**: A flexible visualization package for thematic maps, supporting both static and interactive mapping in R.\n-   **`tidyverse`**: A collection of R packages designed for data science, emphasizing data manipulation, visualization, and functional programming.\n-   **`knitr`**: A dynamic report generation tool in R, allowing for the integration of code, results, and narrative in reproducible documents.\n\nBelow, we import these packages into our environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(sf, spdep, tmap, tidyverse, knitr, GWmodel)\nset.seed(123)\n```\n:::\n",
