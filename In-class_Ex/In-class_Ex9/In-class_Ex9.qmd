# 9 Introduction

In this exercise, we will perform a variety of exercises to reinforce our learning from Hands-on Exercise 9.

We also discussed further data preparation and wrangling techniques for take-home exercise 3, similar to how we did in In-class Exercise 8.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, spdep, GWmodel, SpatialML, tmap, rsample, Metrics, tidyverse)
set.seed(1234)
```

```{r}
mdata=read_rds('data/mdata.rds')%>%
  st_jitter(amount=2)
view(mdata)
```
