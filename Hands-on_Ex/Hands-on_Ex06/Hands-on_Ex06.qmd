# 6 Introduction

In this hands-on exercise, we will delineate homogeneous regions by using geographically referenced multivariate data.

There are two analytical techniques that we will focus on for this:

-   Hierarchical Cluster Analysis

-   Spatially Constrained Cluster Analysis

# 6.1 Data and Packages

For this exercise, we will use the following two data-sets:

1.  Myanmar Township Boundary Data (i.e.Â *myanmar_township_boundaries*) : This is a GIS data in ESRI shapefile format. It consists of township boundary information of Myanmar. The spatial data are captured in polygon features.

2.  *Shan-ICT.csv*: This is an extract of [**The 2014 Myanmar Population and Housing Census Myanmar**](https://myanmar.unfpa.org/en/publications/2014-population-and-housing-census-myanmar-data-sheet) at the township level.

Both these data-sets were download from [Myanmar Information Management Unit (MIMU)](#0).

The following packages will be used:

-   **`sf`**: Provides simple features support for handling and analyzing spatial vector data in R.

-   **`tidyverse`**: A collection of R packages designed for data science, emphasizing data manipulation, visualization, and functional programming.

-   **`tmap`**: A flexible visualization package for thematic maps, supporting both static and interactive mapping in R.

-   **`spdep`**: A package for spatial dependence and spatial regression analysis, particularly for handling spatial weights.

-   **`corrplot`**: A package for visualizing correlation matrices using graphical methods such as heatmaps or circle plots.

-   **`ggpubr`**: A package built on ggplot2 that simplifies the creation of publication-ready plots with additional customization options.

-   **`heatmaply`**: An interactive heatmap package that integrates with plotly, enabling dynamic heatmap visualizations for complex data.

-   **`cluster`**: A package providing methods for cluster analysis, including hierarchical clustering and partitioning techniques like k-means.

-   **`ClustGeo`**: A package for performing spatially-constrained hierarchical clustering that accounts for both geographical proximity and data features.

We now import the above packages into our environment using the p_load function of the pacman package.
